      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Mix chipotle hot sauce, rice vinegar, soy sauce, ginger, and agave
          syrup together in a small bowl to make sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat olive oil and sesame oil in a wok or large skillet over medium
          heat. Add ground turkey; cook, stirring to break up clumps, until
          juices run clear, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
          Transfer to a bowl, reserving juices in the wok.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine coleslaw mix, red bell pepper, green onions, and garlic in the
          wok; cook and stir over medium heat until slaw is slightly wilted, 1
          to 2 minutes. Add sauce; mix to combine, about 1 minute. Return turkey
          to the wok and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle sesame seeds over slaw before serving.</li>
